# Wine_Quality_Prediction
The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The target table has red and white variants. 
The following column names are present:
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality

Different ML algorithms are applied, to compare the accuracy.
